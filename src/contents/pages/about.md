title: About Me
description: Long story, made it short :)
---

You may already know me, or perhaps a link led you here. For online-me, the only important thing right now is that you are here. I'm Behnam, and I'm glad to have you.

I've spent a significant portion of my life behind a screen, probing, investigating, and learning new things. I've even gained many of my hobbies from these screens, but I don't like video games. I like watching movies, I love reading, and I hate ignorance of any kind. In my humble opinion, geographical borders are meaningless. What matters is humanity, and any kind of patriotism and nationalism will ultimately lead to failure.

In my career, I have chosen to gravitate towards and focus on front-end engineering, but I have also participated in many projects with different titles and responsibilities within the scope of programming. Currently, I call myself a JavaScript developer who can write simple scripts with GoLang and Python.

I'm 31 now, and I've loved coding since I was 11. I believe this love led me to study software engineering, from which I graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2015.

Some important dates in my life:

- August 2018: Married Hani ❤️
- August 2019: Immigrated to Istanbul, Turkey
- April 2022: Immigrated to Amsterdam, the Netherlands

Please don't hesitate to contact me. I'd be happy to respond.

*Wishing you well :)*
