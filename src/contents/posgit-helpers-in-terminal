Sometimes we all need to remember the structure of a git command or it's options. Depending on the situation, we get help from either google or terminal help commands.
But we are often exposed to too much content and can get lost in tons of text just to find something simple in both google search results and terminal manpages.

To make this journey simple, it's better to know git help commands and their diffirances;

Git provides `git help <verb>` command to get descriptive and detailed help (manpage) about the target verb. for example `git help push` will prompt the manual page of the push command;

There are two other commands like `git help` to see the manual page, `git <verb> --help` and `man git-<verb>`.

Now you know that the results of these three commands are equal:
`man git-push` = `git help push` = `git push --help`

But what if you only need a quick review of command options? You can use `git <verb> -h` in this case, like `git push -h` which will print out the related options and a brief description of each.

As a bonus for this short post, there is also a handy tool named **tldr** which provides a simplified version of manpages and contains examples rather than detailed explanations.
You can install it by `npm i -g tldr` and use it like `tldr git-push`.
BTW, **tldr** is not only for git commands but also for all commands available to **man**.

Enjoy :)
