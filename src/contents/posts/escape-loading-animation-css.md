Hi there, I hope you all are in a good mood. Today when I was surfing in Dribbble, I faced a cool loading animation, a
fantastic loop animation. it drew my attention, and I could not ignore it. As far as I remember I was just gazing at its
GIF for 10-12 minutes and that gave me good feelings.

The design belongs to [Vitaly Silkin](https://dribbble.com/colder), and he shared this on his Dribble profile about 2
years ago.

Anyway, I decided to code it. It took almost 3 hours and 30 minutes but was genuinely enjoyable and be worth it. I was
code with pure CSS then added it to the **[practical front-end project's collection](https://bit.ly/pfep-2020)** as a
new cool member.

**[You can see the demo here](https://bit.ly/2KVz3vu)**. Also, you can customize
the [source on Codepen](https://codepen.io/bhnmzm/pen/WNQXbMz) too.

When it's done, I wrote an email to Mr. Silkin, and I thanked him because of his beautiful design. Also, I wrote to him
I hope he doesn't be mad at me for doing it without permission. And I closed the email with this: Your potential friend,
Behnam ;)

Sometimes a simple design, a brief sentence, or a short story can make us happy so much more than we expected.
especially in these tough days and in the middle of that much work.

Comment your feelings and make me happy more ;)
