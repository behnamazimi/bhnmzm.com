In the new project of the [practical front-end projects](https://github.com/behnamazimi/practical-front-end-projects)
series, I went over to the HTML Canvas, and I tried to make a beautiful animated wallpaper. The result was satisfying for
me; I hear a slow love song in the background when it plays.
xD. [You can see the demo here](https://behnamazimi.github.io/simple-web-projects/canvas-wallpaper/).

Actually, the project is very simple and I'm sure reviewing its code will be so useful. I tried my best to make a fully
documented and easy to read code. But you can also ask me detailed questions
or [open issues on Github](https://github.com/behnamazimi/practical-front-end-projects).

This is a practical canvas tutorial, an animated wallpaper with circles that move on it. The primary goal was focusing
on the canvas methods, but next to it, you can find some useful coding strategies and mathematical operations in code.

I hope it will be useful for you. I'm looking forward to your comments.
