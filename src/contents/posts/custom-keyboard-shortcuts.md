You know that shortcut keys in a website limited to the shortcuts defined by the developer or owner. And this could be
terrible and tormenting when you are doing routine and repetitive works on a website with a mouse.

There are three solutions to this. You can write a script and execute it to do your action if you are a programmer. Or
you can ask the development team to add the shortcut you need, which is silly and almost impossible :D.

The third solution is to use
the **[In-site Shortkeys extension in Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/in-site-shortkeys/dgigbgdgmhhncfgaidcbmafkcmagkool)**
. You can easily define shortcut keys for specific operations on a website with this extension. It’s easy to use, you
just need to press the add shortkeys button. The extension will catch your clicks, then you can define custom keys as a
shortcut to call your operations on that website.

Adding multi-step operations is an outstanding feature of
the **[In-site Shortkeys](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/in-site-shortkeys/dgigbgdgmhhncfgaidcbmafkcmagkool?hl=en&authuser=0)**
. This means that you can set shortcuts for consecutive clicks and when the keys fired, it will execute the operation
step by step with a pre-defined delay between each step.

It’s possible to add shortcuts to execute custom Javascript codes on a website also, you can share these script
shortcuts with other websites.

The shortkeys are unique to each domain it means that keyboard shortcuts defined for a site are callable only on that
site.

In determining shortcuts, any combination of keys is valid except chrome-reserved shortcuts like ctrl + n, ctrl + w,
ctrl + shift + n, etc.

The point to note is that the extension only works on websites. It means you need to focus on the website itself, not
another window.

The [In-site Shortkeys is an open-source project (GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/behnamazimi/in-site-shorteys), so you
can contribute if you wish. I hope this extension will be useful to you.
